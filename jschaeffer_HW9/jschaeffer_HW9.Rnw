In lecture 16, we looked at precipitation amounts in Madison County (at 
Morrisville station). We found that the Weibull distribution had a good fit
to the monthly precipitation amounts.\\

We found that the MLEs for the Weibull distribution were 
\begin{align*}
    \hat{a}&=2.1871\\
    \hat{\sigma}&=3.9683
\end{align*}
and
\[-\mathcal{L}(\{\hat{a}, \hat{\sigma}\}|\mathbf{x}) = 2166.496\]
is the realized negative log-likelihood.
Note this means that the log-likelihood is
\[\mathcal{L}(\{\hat{a}, \hat{\sigma}\}|\mathbf{x}) = -2166.496,\]
and the usual likelihood is
\[L(\{\hat{a}, \hat{\sigma}\}|\mathbf{x}) = e^{\left[\mathcal{L}(\{\hat{a}, \hat{\sigma}\}|\mathbf{x})\right]} \approx = e^{-2166.496},\]
which \texttt{R} cannot differentiate from 0.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Someone asked ``why Weibull?" in class. That is, why wouldn't we use 
  another right-skewed distribution like the Gamma (see Lecture 15), or
  the Log-Normal (see Lecture 17).
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Compute the MLEs for these data using a Gamma distribution. \\
    Calculating the MLEs results in $\hat{\alpha} = 4.174581$ and $\hat{\beta} = 1.189099$.
    \item Compute the MLEs for these data using the Log-Normal distribution. \\
    Calculating the MLEs results in $\hat{\mu} = 1.131361$ and $\hat{\sigma} = 0.5333432$.
    \item Compute the likelihood ratio to compare the Weibull and the Gamma distribution. 
    Which has a better fit according to the likelhiood ratio?
    \[Q = \frac{L(\{\hat{a}, \hat{\sigma}\}|\mathbf{x})}{L(\{\hat{\alpha}, \hat{\beta}\}|\mathbf{x})}=e^{\left[\mathcal{L}(\{\hat{a}, \hat{\sigma}\}|\mathbf{x}) - \mathcal{L}(\{\hat{\alpha}, \hat{\beta}\}|\mathbf{x})\right]}\] 
    Calculating the likelihood ratio yields the result $2.161318e-07$, which indicates that gamma distribution is a better fit.
    \item Compute the likelihood ratio to compare the Weibull and the Log-Normal distribution.
    Which has a better fit according to the likelihood ratio?
    \[Q = \frac{L(\{\hat{a}, \hat{\sigma}\}|\mathbf{x})}{L(\{\hat{\mu}, \hat{\sigma}\}|\mathbf{x})}=e^{\left[\mathcal{L}(\{\hat{a}, \hat{\sigma}\}|\mathbf{x}) - \mathcal{L}(\{\hat{\mu}, \hat{\sigma}\}|\mathbf{x})\right]}\]
    Calculating the likelihood ratio yields the result $2.37062e+16$, which indicates that weibull distribution is a better fit.
    \item Compute the likelihood ratio to compare the Gamma and the Log-Normal distribution.
    Which has a better fit according to the likelhiood ratio?
    \[Q = \frac{L(\{\hat{\alpha}, \hat{\beta}\}|\mathbf{x})}{L(\{\hat{\mu}, \hat{\sigma}\}|\mathbf{x})}=e^{\left[\mathcal{L}(\{\hat{\alpha}, \hat{\beta}\}|\mathbf{x}) - \mathcal{L}(\{\hat{\mu}, \hat{\sigma}\}|\mathbf{x})\right]}\]
    Calculating the likelihood ratio yields the result $1.09684e+23$, which indicates that gamma distribution is a better fit.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Optional Coding Challenge. Choose the ``best" distribution and refit the
  model by season.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Fit the Distribution for Winter (December-February).
    \item Fit the Distribution for Spring (March-May).
    \item Fit the Distribution for Summer (June-August).
    \item Fit the Distribution for Fall (September-November).
    \item Plot the four distributions in one plot using \texttt{cyan3} for Winter,
    \texttt{chartreuse3} for Spring, \texttt{red3} for Summer, and \texttt{chocolate3}
    for Fall. Note any similarities/differences you observe across the seasons.
